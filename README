NAME
    CLI::Display - a set of text display helpers, and more, for command line
    tools.

SYNOPSIS
     use CLI::Display qw/:prints continue_or_abort/;

     print_g "this is my green: ", $text, "\n";
     print_y "highlighting this using yellow color\n";
     print_e "a multi "; print_y "color "; print_g "line"; print "...\n";

     # wait for user to continue or abort the script and indent 
     # all output by 1 tab
     continue_or_abort 1;

DESCRIPTION
    A simple lib of methods that help colorize your CLI tool output using
    the Term::ANSIColor lib.

    More helpers are introduced as I need more for my CLI tools.

FUNCTIONS
  print_g (@)
    Works just like regular 'print' but it colors the output as green.

  print_y (@)
    Same as print_g but uses yellow.

  print_r (@)
    Same as print_g but uses red.

  continue_or_abort (@)
    Halts the script waiting for user input, which needs to be either 'y' or
    'n'.

SEE ALSO
    Term::ANSIColor::Print a much better alternative if you want something
    more complex in generating output. It's OO though.
